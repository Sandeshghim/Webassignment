        <h2> Day I</h2><br>
        <p>The first day of my assignment, I was too nervous and confused from where to start my assignment. Due to the online classes, I havenâ€™t understood complete CSS. So I know it will be hard for me to implement it in my assignment. So, at first, I draw my first layout image in my notebook and tried to implement it in sublime- text. On the first day I designed my homepage layout with simple colorsand I pushed my work in GitHub. </p><br>

        <h2> Day II</h2><br>
        <p>On the second day of my assignment, the first home layout is already designed. It was very simple. After that, I added my picture to my home page by giving a very short introduction.. I changed my whole layout because it did not look much attractive So, I decided to put my picture as whole background.  I also started working in my contact form on my 2nd day of the assignment.</p><br>

        <h2>DayIII</h2><br>
        <p>On the third day of my assignment, I complete my contact page. And started to apply CSS to my pages but It was not easy as I thought. I had a lot of problems with CSS.  I also started my blog and site report. So, that I can easily complete my assignment on time. I pushed all my work in GitHub </p><br>
        <h2>DayIV</h2><br>
        <p>On the fourth day, the final day of my assignment I complete all my work, pushed it to GitHub. I give the final touchup to my CSS. I tried to make my website responsive so that it can easily work on both laptops and mobile phones. I recorded my video through a screen recorder explaining my work and my assignment is completed. The only thing I need to do is submit my assignment through the Nile. </p><br>
