                Our web development assignment has some terms and conditions that we should follow throughout the assignment. University also provides us marking scheme. So, that we can understand how our marking is done. Templates, bootstraps are banned, absolute positing are banned. Before starting my assignment I watched all the lecture slides and I designed my first homepage layout in my notebook. I started my coding in sublime text.  I designed the modality of my assignment. I decided that my website background color will be royal blue, the navbar color will be white and the main text will be in black. Rather than using a different kind of logo, designs I preferred a simple one because I thought that, rather than looking at different videos from youtube or looking at different website samples why not make your simple-looking website. I used very simple codes, simple colors. At first, I put my navigation bar at the top of the page but later on, I realized that I was creating a bit of a problem. So I put it on the right side of the page. I also changed the class= name from row to column. I added a small introduction below my picture. I designed my portfolio and contact page. For the contact page, I watched the video of Nepali Youtuber Bishowraj Poudel. I wrote my blog by dividing part Day I, Day2, and Day 3. 

                During my assignment, I faced a problem in different sections, I had problems mostly with CSS which is the longest designing part of the assignment. Due to the online classes, it is really difficult for me to learn these HTML and CSS.
